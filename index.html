                    Itâ€™s time to roll out your yoga mat and discover the combination of
                    physical and mental exercises that for thousands of years have
                    hooked yoga practitioners around the globe. The beauty of yoga is
                    that you donâ€™t have to be a yogi or yogini to reap the benefits.
                    Whether you are young or old, overweight or fit, yoga has the power
                    to calm the mind and strengthen the body. Donâ€™t be intimidated by
                    yoga terminology, fancy yoga studios and complicated poses. Yoga is
                    for everyone.

                    Knowing the weather is something that we all pretty much need to
                    know. Smartphone weather apps and weather widgets have been steadily
                    improving over the years and they are better than they have ever
                    been. They work better, have more detailed and accurate information,
                    and the weather widgets generally look better and more modern. These
                    days, you can get some crazy good radar, even if Dark Sky doesnâ€™t
                    exist on Android anymore. There are a ton of great options, but we
                    think we narrowed down the best of the best. Here are the best
                    weather apps and weather widgets currently available on Android.

                <p>
                    Yogurt (UK: /ËˆjÉ’É¡É™t/; US: /ËˆjoÊŠÉ¡É™rt/,[1] from Turkish: yoÄŸurt) also
                    spelled yoghurt, yogourt or yoghourt, is a food produced by
                    bacterial fermentation of milk.[2] The bacteria used to make yogurt
                    are known as yogurt cultures. Fermentation of sugars in the milk by
                    these bacteria produces lactic acid, which acts on milk protein to
                    give yogurt its texture and characteristic tart flavor.[2] Cow's
                    milk is the milk most commonly used to make yogurt. Milk from water
                    buffalo, goats, ewes, mares, camels, yaks and plant milks are also
                    used to produce yogurt. The milk used may be homogenized or not. It
                    may be pasteurized or raw. Each type of milk produces substantially
                    different results.
